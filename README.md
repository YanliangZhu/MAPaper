Employing the steady-state assumption, we can model job vacancies over time as:
$$
v(t)=V_0(1-q)^t
$$
where $V_0$ is the inflow of new job vacancies created at $t=0$, and $q$ is the probability of a vacancy being filled during period $t$. The geometric series of the model would be:
$$
V_{a,b}=\sum_{t=a}^{b}v(t) \\
V_{a,b}={V_0(1-q)^a\left(1-(1-q)^b\right)\over1-(1-q)}
$$
